Description: adjusting my game to accept user input to effect the number of squares and bombs. Will merge branches when I'm done.

Things I've Added:
-Generalized the code to work with any given AxA (square) board and any number of bombs; versus 6x6 with 6 bombs being hard coded in.
-The settings(cog) button prompts the user for number of rows. If they give an answer, prompts for number of bombs. 
-Have a function to change the number of squares displayed.
-Successfully used sessionStorage to store values from prompts. Upon reload, a function checks sessionStorage and updates board accordingly.

To do:
-add function to check user input (ex. number of bombs cant be bigger than number of squares); set limits
-visuals need some adjusting for large square count (ex. 40x40 and higher) under the limit

Extra To do:
-learn to build custom pop-up instead of using built-in prompt function
-handle non-square dimensions
